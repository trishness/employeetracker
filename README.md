# employeetracker
This assignment incorporated MySQL databases with command line functionality. It allows the user to create multiple tables that show different information pertaining to their employee database, including departments, roles, and specific employees. From there, the tables must be connected and pulling specific information from each other. The "role" table requires information from the "department" table, and the "employee" table requires information from the "role" table as well as information from other employees living within the table. To access this information, foreign keys were included to link information together within the prompts. Once each table has been created, the user should be able to not only add information into the tables, but also view them upon request. Modifications can be made to the "role" table, should a role's salary change. After each task is complete, the user will be prompted to continue adding, modifying or viewing information, or, if the user has finished their work, they may choose to "Exit" in order to end the connection with the database.
